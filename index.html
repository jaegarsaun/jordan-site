                <div class="left-txt">It could be said that Michael Jordan was the genesis of basketball as we know it
                    today. Throughout a fiery and storied career, the tireless MJ overcame his hurdles, soaring above
                    challenge after challenge to realize the unexpected. Along the way, he redefined basketball's
                    relationship to style, the sport’s connection to youth counter-culture and the game’s creative
                    potential.</div>
                <div class="right-txt">Like Jordan himself, his eponymous footwear arrived with a bang, sharing its
                    namesake’s tradition-breaking bravado. A black and red colorway violated the league’s uniform
                    policy, earning a stern letter from league officials and generating a $5,000 fine each time the
                    player wore the shoes on court. It is with this brazen charisma that the Air Jordan lineage was
                    born.</div>

        <h2 class="foot-head">THE "GOAT"</h2>
        <p class="shoe-body smaller">Michael Jordan is a former American professional basketball player and businessman. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time and is credited with popularizing the sport during the 1990s.<br class="break">

            Jordan was born on February 17, 1963, in Brooklyn, New York and grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina. He showed an early interest in basketball and began playing the sport in high school, where he quickly established himself as a star player.<br  class="break">
            
            After high school, Jordan attended the University of North Carolina, where he continued to shine on the basketball court. He was selected as the third overall pick in the 1984 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls and went on to have a illustrious career in the league.<br class="break">
            
            Over the course of his career, Jordan won six NBA championships, five Most Valuable Player awards, and ten scoring titles. He was a 14-time All-Star, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, and a member of the 1992 "Dream Team," which is widely considered to be the greatest basketball team of all time.<br class="break">
            
            Off the court, Jordan has been equally successful as a businessman. He has endorsement deals with a number of major companies and is the owner of the NBA's Charlotte Hornets.
            
            Jordan's impact on basketball and popular culture cannot be overstated. He remains one of the most recognized and beloved athletes in the world and continues to inspire future generations of basketball players.</p>
